A vanilla-like texturepack featuring dark-mode, custom sky, 3D details for blocks and some small texture tweaks to make the game look more dynamic.

This is the low version, which doesn't include features like 3d models or custom sky. I couldn't upload the full version because it bigger than 25 MB (and GitHub doesn't like that)
You can download the full version via the [Sunfur Edit Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/sunfur-edit).

**The full version requires optifine or mods with similar resourcepack support to work properly.**

You can find a modpack with this kind of support for fabric mc 1.20 [here](https://modrinth.com/modpack/limitless1.20). or just download and install [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) instead.
