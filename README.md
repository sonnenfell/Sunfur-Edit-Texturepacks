A vanilla-like texturepack featuring dark-mode, custom sky, 3D details for blocks and some small texture tweaks to make the game look more dynamic.

To download the texturepack, go to the latest release or the [Sunfur Edit Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/rHOdBfrf). The texturepack variants are also available here in the release release section or on the respective [variant's Modrinth pages.](https://modrinth.com/collection/YYDST57h)

## Dependencies:

The current version is tested and works for minecraft version 1.20.x, but since minecraft is really nice to texturepacks it should be compatible with a lot more versions starting with 1.12.

While the low version is fully functional in vanilla minecraft, the full version requires optifine or mods with similar resourcepack support to work properly.

You can find a modpack with this kind of support for fabric mc 1.20 [here](https://modrinth.com/modpack/limitless1.20) - if you never installed minecraft mods yourself before, I recommend using the [Modrinth launcher](https://modrinth.com/app) for this (since it's foolproof and quite versatile). Alternatively, you could also just download and install [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) instead.

## How to activate the resourcepack:

1. Download the "Sunfur Edit" version you like (Don't extract it! To download the full version, [go to this site](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/sunfur-edit))
2. Find and open minecrafts "resourcepacks" folder (if you don't how to do this, you can find a simple the step by step tutorial below)
3. Drag or copy the .zip file in this folder
4. Open the Resource Packs selection menu in Minecraft
5. Select the resourcepack you want to activate by clicking on the arrow facing right while hovering the texturepack in the selection menu
6. Click "Done" to exit the selection menu and apply the texture pack
The resourcepack is now active.

If you don't see any changes, make sure that any other active resourcepacks are below the "Sunfur Edit" pack in the "Selected" list.
To deactivate a texturepack, simply go back to the selection menu and select the arrow facing left while hovering the active texturepack.


**If you don't know where your resourcepacks folder is:**
  1. Start Minecraft
  2. Navigate to "Options" -> "Resource Packs..."
  3. On the bottom of the pack selection screen, click "Open Pack Folder"
  4. This will automatically open the current instance's resourcepack-folder in explorer.
  Now just continue on with the other steps.

# Changelog: Sunfur Edit 1.1 + Variants
After some quite intensive testing, I believe I have removed all issues there were with the previous version (like glitched models, compatability issues with glass culling texturepacks etc.). There _shouldn't_ be any problems now, but if you do find one please contact me so I can fix it. Now, let's take a look at the changes:

## "Sunfur Edit" Patchnotes:
- **There's a shader friendly version now! Use it if the sky looks weird when using a shader and the texturepack at the same time (or if you just want the full version but no custom sky stuff)**
- **Removed the 3d Potion models & fixed potion texture**
- **Added compatibility with glass culling texturepacks**
- **Removed some 3d inventory models so the inventory UI on servers looks decent again** _(this only affects items in inventory slots/item frames, the actual blocks still have the same model as before)_
- **Removed the admittedly weird custom models of swords, shovels and pickaxes** _(the crossbow model is still there, don't worry)_
- **fixed the compass model**
- **sun and moon are smaller now** _(because I think they were way too big, especially the moon - it looks more "realistic" now)_
- **drastically decreased file size of the "low" version (it's less than 0.5mb now!)**

At the same time as this release, I also overhauled this packs Modrinth page: The main page will be exclusively used for releases of the full version of "Sunfur Edit". The other variants, "Sunfur Edit - low" (lite version optimised for performance and file size) and "Sunfur Edit - shader friendly" (full version without custom sky elements, can be used with shaders without affecting their custom sky), each get a seperate Modrinth page which will be used exlusively for releases of the respective variant. You can find active links to all "Sunfur Edit" variants [here](https://modrinth.com/collection/YYDST57h).


_P.S.: As you may have noticed, I often use the term "texturepack" instead of "resourcepack". I do acknowledge and agree that "resourcepack" is, objectively, the better term since these packs can not only contain textures, but also models, shaders and sounds. The reason I'm using "texturepack" although I know it's the inferior term is simply because it was the most commonly used expression in my surroundings back when I first came in contact with it, so I grew quite fond of it. That's it. Enjoy the pack!
